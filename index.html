        <h3>Creepy Babies In Sims 4</h3>
        <p>
          We are not the first to speak of these demon babies and we certainly
          won't be the last. They have even been featured as their own article
          on Kotaku. Though the glitch is rather harmless, it may cause a lot
          of psychological damage. Those babies are nightmare fuel with
          claw-like arms and eyes that bounce out of their sockets.

        <h3>Mount & Blade: Warband's Face In The Sky</h3>
        <p>
          This is one of those crazy glitches you need to see to believe. Yes,
          the entire sky can turn into a face. It is not a pretty face either,
          as its skin stretches beyond to each horizon and its mouth hangs
          open. It is hilarious and creepy, like something out of a Rick and
          Morty episode. Lets hope the glitch is not permanent!

        <h3>Sharks Leaving The Water In Crysis</h3>
        <p>
          This glitch is a mixture of terrifying and funny. It has sharks
          leaving the ocean and glitching about the beaches! One particular
          video shows a player who kills a shark, but it comes back to life
          and gets onto the beach and drags its face through the sand as this
          player panics and shoots a ton of bullets at it. The sharks are huge
          too! It is like a scene out of one of those bad shark movies.

              <h3 class="w-75">
                Remember when you were a kid, and pure, unadulterated joy was
                part of most every day? We didn't have to ask ourselves, “What
                makes me happy?” We just knew and made it our mission to do
                those happy things. But adulthood and responsibilities take us
                farther and farther away from the pure happiness of our youth.
                We get so caught up in the work of life that we lose touch
                with the joy of living.

              <h3 class="w-75">
                Fear, which was once an appropriate reaction to real and
                present danger, is now the reaction to any imagined negative
                outcome. Fear is mostly a product of our imaginations, almost
                always without any true basis in reality. We fear failure. We
                fear success. We fear the future. We fear the past. We fear
                possiblescenarios with only a shred of evidence to lead us
                there. The more we think about what wefear, the more we feed
                the fear. Then fear begins to control us, limit us, and
                ultimatelyovertake us.

              <h3 class="w-75">
                We put a lot of stock in our beliefs. We've spent a long time
                cultivating them, supporting them, proving to others that we
                have the last word on the subject.do this with our beliefs
                about religion, politics, sexuality, child rearing,
                money,lifestyle, and any number of lesser areas of life (where
                we still feel compelled to take astand). But once we are
                firmly lock in to a point of view, we lose.We lose
                perspective, kindness, and a learner's mindset.

                Life offers endless opportunities, and we often feel compelled
                to chase them all, believing success will bring happiness. Yet
                with each achievement comes more responsibilities, tasks,
                events, clutter, and distractions. Over time, life grows
                increasingly complex—what once felt manageable becomes
                overwhelming. Our time is stretched, our energy drained, and
                our attention scattered. We stay busy but not necessarily
                productive, full but not always fulfilled, and in the rush, we
                begin to lose sight of what truly matters.

          <h3>Mistake 1:</h3>
          <p>
            Go shut yourself in a clutter-free, distraction-free room with a
            pen and paper. Think about all of the things you did as a child, a
            teenager, and a young adult (before you had major
            responsibilities) that brought you happiness. Write them down. Now
            think about some things you've done in recent years (whether in
            work or life in general) where you have felt really happy or
            content. Write those down as well.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-24 text-center">
          <h3>Mistake 2:</h3>
          <p>
            Examine your fears under a magnifying glass. Break them down and
            study all of the parts. How much truth is there really in each
            fearful thing? What are the odds that the fearful thing will come
            to pass? Leave no fear un-probed, until you become bored with
            fear. Become practiced at seeing fear as a weak and capricious
            companion, only useful when you are dealing with reality.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-24 text-center">
          <h3>Mistake 3:</h3>
          <p>
            You don't have to give up your beliefs — just your attitude about
            them. Open yourself to other points of view. In fact, seek out
            other points of view. Look at the topic from every angle and be
            discerning. You will be a more interesting and understanding
            person.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-24 text-center">
          <h3>Mistake 4:</h3>
          <p>
            Begin simplifying your life. Start with clutter. Then material
            things that you no longer use. Then start chopping unnecessary
            tasks and events. Pare down. Trim back. Craft your life into the
            purest essence of exactly what you love the most so that your
            precious time is spent in the best way possible.
